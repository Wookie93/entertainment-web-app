## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- TailwindCSS
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- Firebase
- Mobile-first workflow
- Atomic design methodology

### Goals

While developing the project, I wanted to learn about and practice styling elements using TailwindCSS. Also, I emphasized the use of Atomic design methodology

### Continued development

In the future I would definitely like to work on optimizing the application, did a little refactoring and look for improvements.

From the functionality I would like to add the ability to delete previously saved favorite videos
To do:

Przerobić że ładuje się nawigacja po prawej a potem reszta elementów
poprawić ulubione
dodać usuwanie
